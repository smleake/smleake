## Hey what's up
### I'm currently a 4th year student at the <a href="https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/">University of Houston</a>
### Prioritizing learning algorithms/data structures, full stack web development and translating that knowledge into

⎷ [**Art**][ttA] [^1] <br>
⎷ [**Interactive Data/Data Visualization**][ttB] [^2]<br>
⎷ **Something to be perplexed at and ponder for at least a few minutes** [^3]

#### When not trying hard to impress people with coding I enjoy: 
- studying Korean (저는 세스 리크예요. 만나서 반가워요.) 
- spending time with my wonderful girlfriend Seung Eun (정승은 <3) and our pet squadron 
- maintaining my health by consistently going to the gym (ideally)
- attempting to make music (attempting)
- being an affable fella (definitively)
